## Installation
**Backend Development Setup**

A starter database is provided which can be used to create and seed a messagely database:
```console
createdb messagely 
psql messagely < messagely.sql
```

We used Node.js for our back-end JavaScript runtime environment. To install the backend dependencies from the package.json file:
```console
npm install
```

Then start up the server (which we have set to start on port 3001):
```console
npm start
```

## Testing

Note: any time you run our tests here, you will need to use the -i flag for Jest so that the tests run "in band" (in order, not at the same time).
